{"name":"GitHub Quick Start by Embedded Haos","tagline":"Get Going Quick","body":"# GitHub Quick-Start!\r\n\r\nVisit the [GitHub](https://github.com/) site and set-up an account using your Ewha email address. Using your Ewha email address is important because GitHub will grant us a research account with many benefits not available to standard users. More on that later.\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple, if we all keep to a format of  'Embedded' followed by an identifying name, (Use your last name?) we will be able to keep track of one another much easier.\r\n\r\ne.g. my account for this work setting is [EmbeddedHaos](http://EmbeddedHaos.github.io).\r\n\r\nSite to visit : https://github.com/join\r\n\r\n### Once account is set-up:\r\n\r\nYou could install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your system and/or perhaps use one of the many [git clients](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux), but i find it much easier to use a portable version of the system as i can put it wherever i need it and blow it away when i am done with it.\r\n\r\nGet my preferred windows tool here : [GitPortable](https://github.com/sheabunge/GitPortable)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can download a [self-extracting zip file](https://github.com/EmbeddedHaos/GitHubQuickStart/blob/master/simpleClient/GitPortableQuickStart.exe?raw=true) i put together to get you going.\r\n\r\nOK, once you've gotten an environment set-up, test it and let me know once you have got it working.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
