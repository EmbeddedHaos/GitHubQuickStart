# GitHub Quick-Start!

Visit the [GitHub](https://github.com/) site and setup an account using your Ewha email address. Using your Ewha email address is important because GitHub will grant us a research account with many benefits not available to standard users. More on that later.

To keep things simple, if we all keep to a format of  'Embedded' followed by an identifying name, (Use your last name?) we will be able to keep track of one another much easier.

e.g. my acount for this work setting is [EmbeddedHaos](http://EmbeddedHaos.github.io).

Site to visit : https://github.com/join

### Once account is setup:

You could install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your system and/or perhaps use one of the many [git clients](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux), but i find it much easier to use a portable version of the system as i can put it wherever i need it and blow it away when i am done with it.

Get my preferred windows tool here : [GitPortable](https://github.com/sheabunge/GitPortable)

Alternatively, you can download a [self-extracting zip file](https://github.com/EmbeddedHaos/GitHubQuickStart/blob/master/simpleClient/GitPortableQuickStart.exe?raw=true) i put together to get you going.

OK, once you've gotten an environment setup, test it and let me know once you have got it working.
